# Discriminative Optimization (DO)

This repository contains the point cloud registration code from the DO paper which was published in CVPR2017.

## To run the demo
1. clone this repository
2. get findPointNormals.m from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/48111-find-3d-normals-and-curvature?focused=3870562&tab=function
3. run demo.m
